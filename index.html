<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm currently a 4th-year PhD student in Computer Science at Rice University. My advisor is <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~eugeneng/">Prof. T. S. Eugene Ng</a> and I work closely with<a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/"> Prof. Ang Chen</a>.
  My research interest generally lies in the modeling, designing and implementation of networking systems. In particular, I work on problems that revolve around the performance,
  fault-tolerance, and reliability issues that arise within modern datacenters. I'm interested in exploiting emerging underlying technologies such as optical devices and programmable switching ASICs to solve those problems.</p>
I obtained M.S. degree from Nanjing University and B.S. degree from Wuhan University, both in Computer Science.

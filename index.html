<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a senior research scientist at Bytedance Inc, working on improving the availability, reliability and performance of Bytedance's global network infrastructure.</p> 
<p>I obtained my PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science, Rice University, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~eugeneng/">Prof. T. S. Eugene Ng</a>. I also worked closely with<a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/"> Prof. Ang Chen</a>.</p>
  My research interest generally lies in the modeling, designing and implementation of networking systems. In particular, I work on problems that revolve around the performance,
  fault-tolerance, and reliability issues that arise within modern datacenters. I'm interested in exploiting emerging underlying technologies such as optical devices and programmable switching ASICs to solve those problems.</p>
